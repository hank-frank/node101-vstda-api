This is a NODE server that will be part of a later project. 

It is holding a to-do list which we can add, remove and check items of by making server requests.

to function make sure npm install has been run. then npm start and visit the site on localhost:8484. 

Adding a /number to the URL will return that number on the to do list if it exists.
